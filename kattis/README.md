# Assignment 2: Kattis Problems with Unittest
### Problems solved:

- [ABC](https://open.kattis.com/problems/abc) (**2.4**)
- [Broken Swords](https://open.kattis.com/problems/brokenswords) (**1.9**)
- [Flow Layout](https://open.kattis.com/problems/flowlayout)(**1.9**)
- [Pizza Crust](https://open.kattis.com/problems/pizza2) (**1.9**)

### Self-assessment
I would give myself full points on this assignment:
- All 4 Kattis problems are of difficulty 1.9 or greater
- Test screenshots
- 6 tests per problem
- Unittests are written in a separate module
- Tests are different from Kattis sample tests
- Solutions are broken down into functions, which are tested separately from __main__
- Makefile used to automate necessary package installation, unit tests, funtional tests, and style guide enforcement
